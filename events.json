What is YHack?
YHack is an international hackathon hosted by and held at Yale, bringing 1500 like-minded hackers and creatives from all over the world.

YHack is a festival of innovation, an arena of tech warriors, and a stage to present your big idea. Jam packed into 36 hours is a rainbow of events (talks, food, rap battles) that go on through the night while caffeinated teams hack on a Python app or program arduino-driven pumpkins to battle over Twitch. 

What is a hackathon?
Hackathons are weekend-long events where students are encouraged to come with an idea and finish with a product. A more detailed explaination http://bit.ly/1t6gjdx. Don’t worry if you don’t have any programming experience, hackathons have workshops and mentors to help beginners get started.

We're a collaboarative student tech community at McMaster University. We run tech social, workshops and we're open to people of all levels of experience in coding.

After a joyful, emotional, and teary proposal, Ari has whole-heartedly said yes to her best friend, Dave. Their story is proof that a massive online community can truly connect strangers, and breed true love. 

I am overjoyed to invite you and your loved ones to Dave & Ari's wedding reception, which will be held at The Big House on September 19th, 2015.

Because of Dave, Ari's life has not only changed once, because of Hackathon Hackers, but twice, after she found herself falling for the man himself. Little did she know, he fell for her too ;) perhaps even TWICE as hard. According to Dave, what started off as just a joke has now become the most amazing reality of his life.

I am so excited for their future together - I can't even begin to imagine the greatness these two will achieve ♥

Dress like you're attending a wedding, but wear shoes that you can dance the night away with. The aisle *will* turn into a dance platform ;)

XOXO,
Evadora Z

We're KPCB, a Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm. We've invested and helped build companies like Google, Twitter, Amazon, Genentech, Nest, Electronic Arts, Square and many others. Stop by our table and talk to us about:

1) The KPCB Fellows Program: http://kpcbfellows.com/
We're traveling to hackathons across the U.S. to tell people about the KPCB Fellows Program, our initiative to match the brightest students from across the country with one-of-a-kind work experiences at companies in our portfolio companies like Uber, Square, Indiegogo, Flipboard, BetterWorks, Airware and many others. Applications open in October! A couple of our fellows will also be around to tell you about their experiences:

Hallie Lomax, 2015 KPCB Engineering Fellow at Opower
Lawrence Yong, 2015 KPCB Design Fellow at BetterWorks
      Come by our table Saturday between 1-3pm

2) #BuildforGood: http://kpcbfellows.com/build-for-good/challenges
We started an initiative to get people excited about building hacks and products for good. We partnered with incredible nonprofits like Product (RED), Ideo.org, Kiva, Internet.org and many others to offer technical challenges to hackers at collegiate hackathons. We'll also be awarding an interview for the 2016 KPCB Fellows Program to the best #BuildforGood hack!

3) KPCB Companies: http://kpcbfellows.com/companies
We have some pretty great companies in our family. And we're happy to tell you about them and why we think they are so great.

We are right near the east entrance of the student center.

Hackitmac is a collaborative student tech community on campus. We host workshops, tech socials, and provide a place for anyone interested in technology.

We also host/participate in hackathons. Hackathons are tech-marathons where students team up and create awesome projects to solve real world problems over the course of a weekend; using software and hardware. To give you an idea, we have buses going to Michigan, Harvard, Waterloo to compete in 3 hackathons this fall semester alone! Hackathons are completely free (food, drinks for the entire week covered). HackItMac teams up with schools to offer free buses from McMaster to most of the hackathons, so you’re hacking for free! 

We also host our very own annual hackathon, DeltaHacks, at McMaster University. This is last years video of it: j.mp/dhacks14

What's the benefit? Hackathons are the perfect opportunity to learn and develop new skills, as well as interact with top companies in the industry today (such as Facebook, Morgan Stanley, Google, and Microsoft, to name a few). Don’t worry if you are just starting out, because we do organize workshops throughout the year; not to mention hackathons always have mentors and workshops to help you get started. Students of all levels are welcome and encouraged.
